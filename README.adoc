=== Ordering SIMs

=== Activating SIMs

=== Getting the first device online

Any device equipped with a SIM card requires an APN (Access Point Name) configuration to establish a data session. Some devices and networks auto-detect the APN but for most cases you need to configure it. 

APN: `em` (or alternatively use `emnify`)

Further some Android / IoS based devices and cellular modules also need to be configured to allow for roaming. 

Select below your device type and model to see how to configure the APN.

===== Quectel cellular IoT modules 

_Applies to all Quectel modules: BG95, BG96, EG25, EG91, EG95, EC21, EC25, M65, M66, M95, MC60, BG77, BG600L_

 
With Quectel modules the APN can be set with the 3GPP standard command AT+CGDCONT  

`AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","em",,`
 
Quectel also utlizes a vendor specific Command AT+QICSGP 

`AT+QICSGP=1,1,"em","","",1`

 
According to link:https://www.quectel.com/faqs/12-8-what-is-the-difference-between-cgdcont-and-qicsgp/[Quectel] the command AT+QICSGP shall be used when the internal TCP/UDP stack should be used – and it also allows to configure which bearer (CSD or GPRS) is used. GPRS must be used.  
 
For managing roaming Quectel also introduced the AT+QCFG command. The suggested setting is: 
 
`AT+QCFG="roamservice",2,1`

NOTE: Check your Quectel module AT command guide for more information.
Further you can also read about AT commands in our <<AT command guide>>. 

===== u-Blox cellular IoT modules


u-Blox supports the standard 3GPP command to set APNs via AT+CGDCONT 

`AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","em",,` 
 
u-Blox also supports a vendor specific command to configure the APN for the initial EPS bearer. 

`AT+UCGDFLT=1,"IP","em"`

For roaming configuration u-blox modules utilize a vendor specific AT+UDCONF command. This enables automatic search in case the device cannot attach to a specific network.  

`AT+UDCONF=20,2`


NOTE: Check your u-Blox module AT command guide for more information.
Further you can also read about AT commands in our <<AT command guide>>.

The AT+CGDCONT command needs to be utilized to set the APN.  

`AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","em",,`

NOTE: Check your AT command guide for further information or read 
link:https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1515[3GPP Technical Specification 27.007]. Further you can also read about AT commands in our <<AT command guide>>.
